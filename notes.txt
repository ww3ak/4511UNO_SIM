FOCUS: game dynamics, strategies, and outcomes

ANALYSIS: 

Game Turn Distributions
- PLOTS: distributions of number of turns per game
- PURPOSE: help understand how long games typically last in terms of turns

Win Rate
- PLOTS: Win rate progression over simulations 
- PURPOSE: win rate across multiple games to see trends or paterns/ A measure of how often a player or strategy won.
